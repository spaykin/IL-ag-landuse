# Illinois Agricultural Land Use & Demographic Changes

## About
This project analyzes agricultural land use and demographic trends in Illinois counties with a focus on the Chicagoland area and collar counties in northeastern Illinois. 
Using the 2012 and 2017 [USDA Census of Agriculture](https://www.nass.usda.gov/AgCensus/) data on farm ownership, economics and demographics, I explore how the average age of IL farmers across most counties continues to increase, leading to implications for farmland ownership and transition. 
Using [Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP)](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/data/land-use) land use data from 2006 and 2013, I highlight where farmland parcels are disappearing to development or consolidation and identify counties with highest rates of farmland loss.
